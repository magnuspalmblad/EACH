| EACH100                         | Method graphs for the 100 annotated Analytical Chemistry papers           |
| generateFigures.R               | R script for making Figures 2-4 and Supplemental Figure 1                 |
| methodAnnotationsToCytoscape.R  | R script for visualizing method graphs in Cytoscape (for Figures 1 and 5) |

The R scripts were used to generate the Figures in the manuscript and can be used to re-generate them with the current EACH100 data.
